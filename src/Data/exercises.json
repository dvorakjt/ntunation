            "body": "NTunation is an intonation-focused aural training application. NTunation is designed to help train musicians to hear subtle differences in pitch to allow them to improve their intonation while playing. Users are offered a series of exercises to complete. Some exercises ask the user to identify if a note is sharp or flat. Others ask the user to adjust a pitch until it is in tune. Practicing these exercises regularly, in combination with learning the pitch tendencies of your instrument, practicing with a tuner and a drone, and other more generic ear-training exercises can greatly improve a musician's ear for intonation."
